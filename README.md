# Hi there 👋
I am **Mattia Sicoli**, a computer engineering student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) 🇮🇹 and I really enjoy working with AI stuff 🖥️ and Robotics 🤖.

## [🤖 Sparkie](https://github.com/sparkiebot/sparkie)

Sparkie is a robot intended to be used as a platform for learning and experimentation. It is designed to entirely be 3D printed and assembled from scratch. It will be able to help people in some daily tasks, such as patrolling, control smart home appliances, remind you of important events, and much more.

It's a [indoor robot](https://youtu.be/v6KLisnR39E) that can bring small objects from one room to another in your house. Transportino has been made entirely by me from its [embedded board](https://github.com/Transportino/transportino_board) ⚡ to its [mechanical aspects](https://github.com/Transportino/transportino/tree/main/mechanics) ⚙️.

This is my first robot and it is essentially a semi-autonomous robot car which [follows a pre defined path](https://youtu.be/alQHWqDbTys) using the combination of two ir sensors.
