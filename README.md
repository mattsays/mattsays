# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am **Mattia Sicoli**, a computer engineering student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).
I have many interests like Space Engineering, Economics, Phylosophy, but my main interest is Robotics and Embeeded tech.

It's a indoor robot that can bring small objects from one room to another in your house. Transportino has been made entirely by me from its embedded board to its mechanical aspects.

This is my first robot and it is essentially a semi-autonomous robot car which follows a pre defined path using the combination of two ir sensors.
