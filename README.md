# Hi there 👋
I am **Mattia Sicoli**, a computer engineering student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) 🇮🇹 and I really enjoying working with AI stuff 🖥️ and Robotics 🤖.

## [🤖 transportino](https://mattsays.dev/transportino) <a href="https://mattsays.dev/transportino"><img align="right" width="180" height="180" margin-left="10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Transportino/transportino/main/images/transportino_logo.png"></a>

It's a [indoor robot](https://youtu.be/v6KLisnR39E) that can bring small objects from one room to another in your house. Transportino has been made entirely by me from its [embedded board](https://github.com/Transportino/transportino_board) ⚡ to its [mechanical aspects](https://github.com/Transportino/transportino/tree/main/mechanics) ⚙️.

## [🤖 ArduCar](https://mattsays.dev/arducar) <a href="https://mattsays.dev/arducar"><img align="left" width="180" height="180" overflow="hidden" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattsays/arducar/main/images/arducar_logo.png"></a>

This is my first robot and it is essentially a semi-autonomous robot car which [follows a pre defined path](https://youtu.be/alQHWqDbTys) using the combination of two ir sensors.
