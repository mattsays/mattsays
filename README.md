# Hi there 👋
I am **Mattia Sicoli**, a computer engineering student at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) 🇮🇹.
I have many interests like Space Engineering 🚀, Economics 📈, Philosophy 🤔, but my current main interest is Robotics and Embedded tech 🤖.

## [🤖 transportino](https://mattsays.dev/transportino) <a href="https://mattsays.dev/transportino"><img align="right" width="180" height="180" margin-left="10px" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Transportino/transportino/main/images/transportino_logo.png"></a>

It's a indoor robot that can bring small objects from one room to another in your house. Transportino has been made entirely by me from its [embedded board](https://github.com/Transportino/transportino_board) ⚡ to its [mechanical aspects](https://github.com/Transportino/transportino/tree/main/mechanics) ⚙️.

This is my first robot and it is essentially a semi-autonomous robot car which [follows a pre defined path](https://youtu.be/alQHWqDbTys) using the combination of two ir sensors.
